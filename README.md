# DeskAnalyse
Uma ferramenta criada por mim, para um projeto de implementação em fabrica. 
This is my first Python project, developed as part of my Computer Engineering degree. The goal was to create a machine analysis tool for use in a factory environment.

Since my background was mainly in hardware, I used AI assistance during development to speed up the process. I’m currently enrolled in programming courses and now have more than just basic knowledge of Python.
